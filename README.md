# pizzamamadjango
This is my first Django website, it's a simple "Pizza place" website where sqlite3 is used for the data 
I also published it with Pythonanywhere, you can check the website here : yethom.pythonanywhere.com
I also created a very simple API to get the pizzas, to test it, simply add /api/pizzas to the url
